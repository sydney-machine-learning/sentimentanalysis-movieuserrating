Inside out 2,"Inside Out 2 talks about ""growing up"" in an emotional way and depicts how growing up is challenging inside our thoughts. The film introduces the emotions we had from the previous movie: Joy, Anger, Sadness, Fear and Disgust. We are also introduced to new emotions: embarrassment, Ennui (boredom), Envy and Anxiety.Riley is about to go to high school but the story focuses on her preparation to officially join the FogHorn Hockey team. As the story progresses, Riley finds herself challenged with her hopes to join the team. Her friendship was wounded, her emotions went all over the place and the pressure got into her head. But eventually, everything goes into their proper places.This sequel film may be animated and made for kids but as an adult, it just hits differently. I can say that this film was partially made for adults and for anyone who is in a bad mental situation. It reminds its viewers how growing older can be tough, how overthinking affects everything else, how decisions that are made today may affect what's next. But it is also a strong reminder that problems, fear, worries and anxieties will come. They are all inevitable but everything will pass. Take a deep breath, stay calm and do not overstress everything. Having a calm mind also affects the way we think. We may feel pressure at any given time but we have to sit back and relax.Do not overstress things at the present. Live at the moment. The future is there but we live at the present, right here, right now. Enjoy life. Remember that you are not alone on whatever you are facing. Keep your friends and family close. And finally, God is always with us.Inside Out 2 is a great film. Every audience will have a different way of enjoying this but just remember, you are who you are. Embrace yourself.",9.00
Inside out 2,"I can't believe I'm saying this, but this is one of the best Pixar movies to date. I did not expect to like this movie very much. Disney and Pixar have been vastly disappointing and even controversial recently, but Inside Out 2 rivals Pixar's best movies like Up, Monsters inc., Ratatouille, The Incredibles and Toy Story in quality.

I found the story very moving. The best animated movies ever made appeal not just to children, but resonate with the more mature audience as well. And that's what this movie does.

The theme was very poignant. I loved the introduction of the new characters and especially how they incorporated anxiety into the transformation of puberty. Anxiety is not fun, but many people struggle with it.

The ending was great too. I love that they didn't wrap it up in a cliche way.",9.00
Inside out 2,"Inside Out 2 (2024) is a powerful sequel to the acclaimed Pixar film, delving deeper into the emotional tragedies and joys of adolescence. This new chapter follows Riley Andersen (voiced by Kensington Tallman) as she transitions from middle school to high school, encountering the turbulence of puberty and stumbling through new social situations.

Riley, fresh from middle school graduation, is invited to join a summer hockey trial by her local coach who she is completely in adoration of and amazed that her and her friends got invited. She faces anxiety about high school separation from her close friends, who will be attending different schools. Her sense of self is just staring to solidify despite the bad news about her besties. She really hopes they can stay connected through their shared passion for hockey.

As Riley confronts these changes, new emotions like Anxiety, Envy, and Embarrassment emerge. These emotions create a challenging internal dynamic, especially when Riley meets Valentina ""Val"" Ortiz, the admired captain of the high school hockey team. Anxiety begins to dominate, banishing all older emotions we got to know in the first Inside Out out from the headquarters and literally into the Vault where recessed memories are kept. This causes Riley to lose confidence and strain her friendships as she attempts to fit in with her new high school peers.

Joy, Sadness, Anger, Fear, and Disgust go on a mission to help Riley retain her sense of self. In addition, the visual elements were all quite amazing. It's like a mental model of what the brain actually looks like. With all the storage units, and the workers trying to put things in the right place, and then the deep-sated secret memories were inside the vault. All of these aspects made the movie seem even more realistic, and made it feel like I actually have that inside my own brain. Through their journey, they realize that every emotion, including the new ones, plays a crucial role in shaping Riley's identity and helping her navigate adolescence's complexities. The film emphasizes the importance of embracing all emotions to truly understand oneself.

Watching Inside Out 2 was an emotional rollercoaster for me. The film masterfully conveyed the emotions of growing up, making me feel sadness, fear, and excitement along with Riley. There were moments where I was on the edge of my seat, anxious about Riley's choices and hoping she would find her true self again. By the end of the movie, Riley gains more than just her original self; she understands what it truly means to be herself, embracing all parts of her emotional spectrum.

Inside Out 2 beautifully captures the essence of growing up, making us laugh, cry, and reflect on the importance of understanding and accepting all parts of ourselves.",9.00
Inside out 2,"It is ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC and INSTANT CLASSIC Pixar masterpiece ever. A triumphant full circle moment for Pixar. An emotional rollercoaster from beginning til the end. Animation is pure perfection. Pacing is brilliant. Musical score is magnificent. Visuals are stunning & dazzling. Story was very beautifully heartfelt. The voice cast performance was incredibly stellar with old and new familiar faces especially Maya Hawke as Anxiety and Ayo Edebiri as Envy being massive standouts. You'll laugh, cry, and fall in love with this movie. It will blow your mind. Really like it's one of the BEST Pixar sequels in ages since Toy Story 3. A special, once in a lifetime cinematic experience full of heart. A MUST-WATCH for everyone!

This will be a massive box office juggernaut & deservedly so.

Totally the best animated movie of the year you'll ever see. Period.

Kudos to Kelsey Mann & the cast & crew of Inside Out 2!",10.00
Inside out 2,"A sequel with beautiful execution and sufficient maturity to make this film a sequel that is no less than the first film. Even though the conflict shown is not as complex as the first film, but it still made my tears almost slide through my eyes. Such as the scene of Bing Bong saying the dialogue ""Take her to the moon for me"" in the first film, I did not find any emotions that were successfully expressed by the dialogue or scenes. But okay, that's okay, I still like it. The point is that you will find a feeling of nostalgia, a strong emotional feeling (although not too much), this film will be liked by every millennial child and children who want to go back to watch the second film to reminisce, I mean children who have grown up. The overall rating for this film is 8/10, it is definitely worth watching.",8.00
Inside out 2,"I didn't think that the first Inside Out was this massive return to form that many other people thought, but it was fine.

The sequel however is one of the worst movies this year. It's worse than Kung Fu Panda 4. The biggest issue with the movie is that it's pointless. It's got the EXACT SAME message as the first movie. If you have seen the first movie you have seen this one.

The new emotions make no sense and this causes so many plot holes. Their emotions are literally the exact same or at least fit into the original characters.

The fact that this movie deals with puberty and they do almost nothing with it is just a testament to how far Pixar has fell off. The first movie alluded at Riley getting into her first relationship, but that isn't even mentioned in this movie.

Pixar used to be masterful storytellers, with mature stories where you couldn't predict the ending. This is just cookie-cutter predictable trash.",2.00
Inside out 2,"I consider the prequel as a real masterpiece. It is so creative, so funny, emotionally touching and entertaining. Best Pixar movie since ages.

So, I must say I had a certain level of expectation when going with my family who see the second part. And don't get me wrong, it is no bad movie at all, it is fast, has some really well done scenes and we felt entertained after all. BUT, and this is a huge BUT, i feel disappointed since Pixar took the easy route. What do I mean: In fact they fully rely on the outstanding scenery and ideas of the prequel and slightly developed it further in a really foreseeable way. Actually everyone of us could have written this story. All other characters next to Riley do not play any relevant role and have no depth (OK, you could interpret that as a major characteristic of puberty) but even Riley's journey of starting into chaos of feelings could have elaborated more creative and beyond of what you could expect from the movie: more and complex emotions, re-build of the control stations, bla bla). And what I criticize the most: 60% of the story has just been copied from the previous film: Riley's emotion mates are puzzling through the labyrinth of her brain to head back to the control tower... As said, the movie is worth watching it, has its moments and is entertaining , but Pixar: you could have done more than the obvious! Compared to the original movie it is a bit of a disappointment respectively the film makers decided to not walk the extra mile to create something magical again.",4.00
Inside out 2,"Comments like ""this may be good for you if you are a teenager"" are exactly what should be feared by the studios, with this movie you are narrowing the audience which was perfect in the first delivery, the over-explanation of character's actions and jokes denote a very poor dialog writing, there are no more memorable quotes, the characters have zero creative development, turning into more of the same in a bad way.

I know almost nothing about writing credits but it makes obvious the change with the first movie, if this is the result of the absence of Pete Docter, believe me, it is remarkable.

There are antagonists like in the first movie but now their development turns out to be far too obvious for example the false enemy which turns to be neccesary, the silly-but-required old memories and the caged-but-misunderstood villians, I mean, this is not a spoiler because is a copy-paste from the first delivery, the inclusion, which is now mandatory, sums nothing to the narrative.

The pace is slow and predictive so I almost fell asleep, my wife almost fell asleep, my two friends almost fell asleep, and at least in the case of my local screenplay I felt constantly the sense of ""why are people laughing at that joke?""

Silly with no sense, only backed by the beautiful artwork, this movie will get forgotten in a couple of weeks, it is nothing compared with its predecessor.

Took the time to write this because I am 100% sure that I wont see it again and maybe could save you some money, wait for the streaming.",4.00
Inside out 2,"Just a confused mess, no real understanding of the world-building that made the first one so good. No character development from the first, either, the plot is basically the same lessons being learned that inside and outside characters learned in the first. And taking the focus away from family, toward a simple, trivial hockey camp? Talk about lowering the stakes.

Basically boring, pointless, and much less fun. The changes in voice actors were jarring, and the additions were messy and for the most part useless. Anxiety could have just been a new manifestation of fear. Embarrassment could have just been a part of disgust. And Ennui? That's not really even an emotion. How about, I don't know, love?

I felt like there was no direction at all. I cared much less about Riley after the end than I did beforehand.

Pixar is officially dead, I think.",4.00
Inside out 2,"The new film is as brilliant and wonderful as the old film was, using a very entertaining and imaginative way to represent emotions and their impact on people, more specifically, a young girl. The metaphors brought to life (e.g., stream of consciousness is stream, train of consciousness is a choo choo) and representations are very creative and very funny. The film gets a 10 for the wonderful images, sounds, and ideas. But it gets a 0 for accuracy. People's behavior is not controlled by emotions - emotions are only one factor that the person deals with. In addition, there is reality, internal processes, and social pressures. Each action takes place in the context of these competing forces. The true ""control panel"" is not in a room with the emotions, but rather the emotions show up on a panel in a different, higher level panel, where all these other impulses and perceptions compete for action that will reward the person and further their goals.",3.00
The Boys ,"I've had big expectations about this show, because I thought that is going to be exactly that kind of show, in which the good guys (the superheroes) fight the bad guys (the villains) and of course, they win. I couldn't have been more wrong, especially because ""The Boys"" it's not about a desperate attempt of superheroes to save the world from evil, instead this show takes a much more realistic approach, about what is going to happen if superheroes had really existed.

I'm saying that I had big expectations in the beginning, because I thought that it would be the same usual show with superheroes and villain, that is most likely to find everywhere. In the first couple of episodes I've been a little bit disappointed, or rather shocked, because like I've already said, ""The Boys"" describes what the MCU never did. Of course, the movies and shows from Marvel are destined to other public's category, but this show is tough. It has all you could not expect from a TV series with superheroes. It has violence, gore, nudity, astonishing CGI effects and a very unpredictable and solid storyline. In the end it seems that this one delivered what I didn't expect it to and I am pleased with that. The show is definitely worth watching.",9.00
The Boys ,"Excellent dystopian reimagining for Superhero nerds. Surprising, violent, always twisting. Binge-watched in 2 days! So glad for a second season, though will be so impatient! Thumbs up.",
The Boys ,"First it's just a very interesting take on the whole superhero genre. But there's also a lot more. Great actors, great storyline and very nice picture. I guess for me it's the best superhero series yet, followed by Titans and Umbrella Academy.",9.00
The Boys ,"There's nothing more that I can really say about The Boys that hasn't already been said. It's just a flat out awesome show! It's easily become one of my favorite new shows in years! I binged the entire first two seasons in just a few days when they first came out and rewatched them again for the second time before Season 3 came out. I was expecting a little bit of a drop off for Season 3 because Season 1 and 2 were so great, and there is a little drop in quality but it's still a very good show! It takes everything you loved about Season 1 and 2 (the violence, humor, heart, craziness, character development, etc.) and takes it all to a whole new level! This show has such an original take on the Superhero genre that is both exciting and hilarious! I can not recommend this show enough! Just a warning though...once you start watching it it's hard to stop. Give yourself enough time because you'll want to binge it as quickly as possible!",8.00
The Boys ,"The Boys is one of the best Superhero shows I've ever seen. While Season 1 was the best season of the series, Season 2 and 3 were also both very good and absolutely worth watching. Season 3 was fantastic, Jensen Ackles was the perfect actor to add to this already incredible show! This show continues to amaze as it's not afraid to try new things and is a show that is definitely for adults. It has no problems being offensive and making you feel squeamish. You don't even have to be a fan of superhero shows to enjoy this. It's violent, funny, thrilling, etc.. Everything you want in a good superhero show. Season 4 just added Jeffrey Dean Morgan to the cast. Another great addition to an already incredible cast. I don't know what else I can say except I absolutely love this series and can't wait for more to come!",10.00
The Boys ,"The concept is great - what if our 'superheroes' weren't really heroes at all? What if they're just like us? Well, they're way worse.

The show is funny. Lots of quirky, clever, and laugh-out-loud scenes. There are, however, many over-the-top, outlandish and vile scenes that go too far. I'm not too keen on shows that use shock value to draw in viewers and this show has a lot of them.

With that aside it's an interesting take on how we generally view superheroes. What is the gist of the show? Imagine a below-average person: overly emotional, bad habits unchecked, and a slew of addictions. Take a bunch of them, give them superpowers, and throw them in positions of power and authority...

You'll quickly see how messy and funny this can get. It's very comedic and refreshing to see something not commonly done before. Again, it's often pushed too far that you lose relatability and sensibility. It's like watching a bunch of degenerate X-Men mutants partying together and that's my weakest point of the show. More world building and character building and less shock value is needed.",5.00
The Boys ,"Well let me start off with the first thing that comes to my mind; zero progression. Last two seasons were great in my opinion, we saw a few new faces, got a deeper background to a few of the characters and even had some character development. But this season was straight up a disappointment. Don't get me wrong I still think The Boys is a great series but there were almost no progression from season 2 AT ALL. Homelander is still alive and well and ruling as usual, the only man who could face Homelander is now back in a coma. This whole season was about finding Soldier Boy and make him kill Homelander and save the people from his crazy dictatorship, but all we got was a failed attempt and now the old man is back in a coma.

I saw a few people mentioning that Homelander is now such a big and important character for the show that he can no longer be killed and defeated. The series has absolutely fooled itself. The hunt for Homelander cannot go on forever, an endless loop of empty attempts to get rid of the most powerful man in the world. I beg that we will see a change next season or this show will crash to the ground.

Season three started off great with alot of new threats and problems for The Boys to solve but it all ended up with being back to where we were at the start of the season...

Hoping for something truly spectacular next season!",3.00
The Boys ,"Hughie Campbell's life is turned upside down when the love of his life is accidentally killed by a superhero, a member of The Seven, the most elite and adored of superhero teams. The Seven are the rock stars of the age and untouchable but the more Hughie investigates, the more he discovers they're far from perfect. His moral crusade sees him drawn into a band of anti-superhero vigilantes: The Boys.

I'm generally not into superhero movies or series but this is different. Here the superheroes are more the villains than the heroes, making for a very interesting and original take on the genre. Throw in some very intriguing sub-plots involving the superheroes' private lives, the politics of their jobs and machinations within their team plus some profound observations and themes involving the (forced) superficiality of public figures, the intrusiveness and control of the media and the influence of social media status and you have a series that is original, entertaining and a mirror of the times.

Action scenes are well done, with some great CGI and graphic grittiness - this is definitely not Disney! While mostly a drama there's some wonderfully funny moments too. Just about anything involving The Deep was always bound to raise a laugh.

Not perfect though. The central plot - The Boys vs the superheroes - often appears clumsy and seems to go around in circles. It starts well enough but after a point, towards the end of Season 1, it just seems to get bogged down in endless escapades that have no point and occur based on the flimsiest of excuses. Plus these escapades often got resolved in silly, plot hole-riddled ways.

The writers would have done better to initially concentrate on the internal machinations within The Seven with the superheroes vs The Boys plot starting as a sideshow and then amping it up as the series went on.

Things do come together quite well in Season 3 though as the plot finds its focus. Season 3 is action-packed and intriguing with some great internal machinations within the superhero camp and a very interesting new character. It was heading for a fantastic showdown but the writers fluffed this somewhat in an effort to prolong the series. The final episode of S3 is a bit confusing and disappointing.

All in all, it's highly entertaining viewing.",7.00
The Boys ,"The storyline was very vague to me considering the previous seasons , they could have easily continued with similar storyline as before .Pathetic job this time",2.00
The Boys ,"""The Boys"" movie attempts to bring the gritty and irreverent tone of the original comic series to the big screen, but unfortunately falls flat in several key areas. First and foremost, the narrative is a convoluted mess, failing to capture the darkly satirical essence of its source material. The plot meanders aimlessly, burdened with unnecessary subplots and poorly developed characters, making it difficult to stay engaged.

The cast, despite their best efforts, are let down by a script that lacks the sharp wit and biting commentary that fans have come to expect. The performances feel forced and unconvincing, as if the actors themselves were struggling to find a coherent thread in the chaotic storyline. The film’s pacing is erratic, with action sequences that, while visually impressive, lack the emotional weight and intensity needed to make them truly impactful.

Visually, ""The Boys"" suffers from an overreliance on CGI, resulting in a glossy, artificial look that detracts from the gritty realism the story aims to portray. The direction feels disjointed, with a lack of cohesive vision that leaves the film feeling like a series of loosely connected scenes rather than a unified whole.

Ultimately, ""The Boys"" movie is a disappointing adaptation that fails to capture the essence of its source material, leaving viewers with a disjointed and unsatisfying experience. Fans of the comic series will likely find themselves frustrated by the film’s inability to deliver on its promise, while newcomers may simply find it confusing and unengaging.",1.00
Top Gun: Maverick,This is one of the best theatrical experiences I've had and I'm so happy someone has taken the practical route rather than throwing everyone into a green screen. I watched the first one many times and I can't believe this just topped it by a huge margin. Tom Cruise will be written as the most passionate filmmaker in history. I mean to put a whole cast in a bunch of f-18 jets and act in a jet as well as film yourself is a huge deal. If this movie does not cross a billion then there is something wrong with taste that people have these days. So called marvel fans. This is what you call a cinematic experience. Not some cropped cgi scenes.,9.00
Top Gun: Maverick,"I was reluctantly dragged into the theater, thinking that they didn't need to make a Top Gun 2 and that the first one was where that story needed to end.

I could write a couple paragraphs to summarize my feelings after walking out of the theater, but I'm going to leave it with just one sentence.

I was wrong.",10.00
Top Gun: Maverick,"In one of the more memorable lines in the original Top Gun, Maverick gets chewed out by a superior who tells him, ""Son, your ego's writing checks your body can't cash."" Sometimes I wonder if Tom Cruise took that putdown as a personal challenge. No movie star seems to work harder or push himself further than Cruise these days. Ridiculously entertaining Top Gun: Maverick. Cruise was in his early 20s when he first played Pete ""Maverick"" Mitchell, the cocky young Navy pilot with the aviator sunglasses, the Kawasaki motorcycle and the need for speed. In the sequel, he's as arrogant and insubordinate as ever: Now a Navy test pilot in his late 50s, Maverick still knows how to tick off his superiors, as we see in an exciting opening sequence where he pushes a new plane beyond its limits. Partly as punishment, he's ordered to return to TOPGUN, the elite pilot-training school, and train its best and brightest for an impossibly dangerous new mission. And so the three screenwriters of Top Gun: Maverick - including Cruise's regular Mission: Impossible writer-director, Christopher McQuarrie - have taken the threads of the original and spun them into an intergenerational male weepie, a dad movie of truly epic proportions. They're tapping into nostalgia for the original, while aiming for new levels of emotional grandeur. To that end, the soundtrack features a Lady Gaga song, ""Hold My Hand."" It's nowhere near as iconic a chart topper as the original movie's ""Take My Breath Away,"" but tugs at your heartstrings nonetheless. The action sequences are much more thrilling and immersive than in the original. You feel like you're really in the cockpit with these pilots, and that's because you are: The actors underwent intense flight training and flew actual planes during shooting. In that respect, Top Gun: Maverick feels like a throwback to a lost era of practical moviemaking, before computer-generated visual effects took over Hollywood. You start to understand why Cruise, the creative force behind the movie, was so driven to make it: In telling a story where older and younger pilots butt heads, and state-of-the-art F-18s duke it out with rusty old F-14s, he's trying to show us that there's room for the old and the new to coexist. He's also advancing a case for the enduring appeal of the movies and their power to transport us with viscerally gripping action and big, sweeping emotions.",9.00
Top Gun: Maverick,"I'll preface my review by first stating that I had mediocre expectations coming in. It's very hard to make a successful sequel to an older classic movie, but I was immediately entertained from beginning to end. I won't give any spoilers, but I'll list my biggest takeaways from the movie.

1. The flying scenes were incredible and had me on the edge of my seat.

2. Tom cruise and miles teller were awesome.

3. I want to quit my job and become a fighter pilot now.

This movie is definitely worth paying for imax tickets and I suggest you get a big water bottle cause you will be sweating profusely as Maverick cuts through the sky like butter.",9.00
Top Gun: Maverick,"Firstly before my small complaint I will point out that I do like the movie.

Now the complaint. This movie uses the exact same formula as Star Wars: The Force Awakens, it remakes the original film almost scene for scene and adds a few new bits. Both films treating the audience with a little bit of contempt whilst cashing in on the nostalgia market.

Having said that, its a fun movie. Teller, as Goose 2.0, works particularly well. It was also great to see Kilmer, despite his current health concerns (he could have been a dynamo for the film if well).

Its fun, loud and obnoxious which is what a Top Gun movie should be :)",6.00
Top Gun: Maverick,"Went with an open mind. Didn't expect anything from the movie. Hadn't even seen a trailer until the reviews were claiming it was a masterpiece, so I decided to check it out. Predictable plot, no stakes, CHEESIEST dialogue you ever heard, piss poor character development, boring plot, etc. This movie is such a waste of time. Was rolling my eyes at Tom Cruise's cheesiness. And Jennifer Connelly's character was so embarrassingly cringe. Also why was the edgy Air Force guy smiling throughout every single line of his. Again, the best way I'd describe this movie is cheesy. What a ridiculous movie.",1.00
Top Gun: Maverick,"I couldn't say it better, so I stole this text: Shallow romance, shallow character work, extremely predictable, how did Tom Cruise even survive at the start, literally no stakes, mission is extremely vague, no one in the film has any understanding of planes and this is coming from an actual pilot. I hate this movie and everyone who liked it.",1.00
Top Gun: Maverick,"I don't understand the overwhelming positive reaction to this film. The writing is so so soooooo lazy. It's like they just thought, ""we need to have a scene that reminds the audience of this part of the original, we need to have a scene that reminds the audience of that part of the original."" It's beyond predictable, reductive, and overly familiar. I get that it's a sequel but this is ridiculous. And Jennifer Connelly - who I usually like very much - is really annoying in this. I don't necessarily blame her, though, I think it's the writing and directing. A real positive though is this: Miles Tenner is perfectly cast.",3.00
Top Gun: Maverick,"There is something something with uranium that needs to be blown up. No details. Tom Cruise comes to the rescue. He is better than the best young trainees 2 generations younger. Het gets the girl, and is hired to save the mission. The girl on the runway in her porsche, Tom with his motorbike and sunglasses driving through the desert with the wind through his hair. Cliche cliche cliche. 80's revival.

Old memories pop up. There is something emotional from the past that needs to be solved. Emotional scene.

Time for action. Nice visuals but you know what will happen.

What a thin cheesy plotline and so predictable.",2.00
Top Gun: Maverick,"The handsome and always-bankable Tom Cruise gets me duped into shelling out $5.99 to rent this. After $1.4 billion+ worldwide gross earnings at the box office and nonstop heavy promotion, I feel compelled to join the bandwagon to revel in this cinematic experience. Fifteen minutes in, I am still giving the movie the benefit of the doubt that something ground-breaking is about to happen. Instead, the shallow, cheesy dialogue continues for the rest of the movie, making all of the characters one-dimensional, even Maverick. Why is Maverick so humble and smiling all the time while the rest of the characters are obnoxious braggarts? It seems that the budget is mostly focused on the set, props, and g-force training for the actors, and they've forgotten to come up with a good script and decent character development. The casting of Jennifer Connelly is a poor choice. Next to the charming Tom Cruise, she has zero charm and therefore there is zero chemistry between them. I should have read the bad reviews first before renting this, instead I trusted Tom Cruise and the movie's box office success, and now I'm $6 and 2 hours in the hole.",4.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"Having read the first few Harry Potter books before 2001 and hearing about the hype for the first movie, I was excited. I heard there was going to be an all-British cast (which makes sense, right?) and we'd get to see a live version of one of the defining novels of our generation. From what I remember I went with my family and a family friend to see the movie the day after Christmas and was pleasantly amazed. After the movie was over, I watched the credits and discovered some familiar names (the late Alan Rickman, Sister Act's Maggie Smith, James Bond 007's Robbie Coltrane, and Star Wars' Warwick Davis); others not so familiar (the kids, some of whom had their debut). But it was a good movie and was a party of colors and sights for all to see. This is easily my favorite of all the Harry Potter films. The catalyst of the movie series!",8.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"Like a lot of others, I refused to watch this film when it was originally released, thinking it was going to be another movie for kids, loosely taken from the source. Was I ever wrong?

J.K. Rowling's novel was brilliantly taken from book to screen. The acting, directing and especially the special effects were tremendously awesome. Director Chris Columbus did a superb job with the direction, I was surprised he didn't get an Academy Award nomination. The acting was too, excellent, especially from the experienced actors like Alan Rickman playing Severus Snape. Truly one of his best performances.

A great adaptation of a very popular book, a fine example of cinema.",7.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"There's nothing like the first in a series, is there? The introduction to the characters, the immersion into the fictional world, the first time you laugh, cry, care, and fear for someone's safety can never be repeated. No matter how many Harry Potter movies they crank out, or if they ever remake them in the future, none will come close to the wonderful first film, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.

I'm sure everyone has their own childhood memories of reading the Harry Potter books that they'll tell their grandkids about, but I'll never forget going to see the first movie in the theaters. The lights dimmed, John Williams's perfect theme played its first notes as Richard Harris walked down Privet Drive, and everyone in the theater was transported to another world. John Williams's numerous themes, all wonderful and a personification of the wizarding world, took the early movies to another level. As other composers tried their hands at the later films, that quality was missing. There's something truly special about going to see this movie on the big screen, and while the ""magical"" qualities might not all be credited to the music, it's certainly one of them.

Welcome to the world of Harry Potter, where if you're a ten-year-old kid who doesn't fit in, you might get a letter delivered by an owl telling you you have magical powers and should go to a special school to hone them. Believe it or not, there are people who watch this movie without reading the books, so a bit of description is necessary. Obviously the stars of the show are the children, who were selected out of millions of other kids to be able to memorize lines, not look in the camera, endear themselves to worldwide audiences, and hopefully act. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, and Tom Felton are so cute and tiny in this first movie, you'll undoubtedly find yourself re-watching it as the years pass just to see them as kids again. I always marvel that child actors train themselves not to look in the camera, so even if their performances aren't perfect, I cut them slack, knowing firsthand how hard it is. And these kids had to dress in funny costumes, recite incantations without laughing, and pretend they're looking at things that were added in post production!

Usually, in kids' movies, there's a grown-up or two who add to the cast and make the adult audience members feel less silly that they're watching it. In the Harry Potter movies, everyone wanted to be in them! Throughout the series you'll see a host of familiar faces as ""guest stars"" but the regulars will make special places in your heart. Richard Harris, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, and Robbie Coltrane are household names for little kids, because they're so convincing as the kindhearted Dumbledore, the wizened but sentimental McGonagall, the endlessly mimicable Snape, and the jolly Hagrid, kids today can't imagine they've had any other career prior to these movies! Is there any kid who doesn't immediately attribute the word ""earwax"" to Richard Harris, point out striped cats as ""Maggie Smith cats"", mumble ""Shouldn't have said that,"" when they make a mistake, or practice putting pauses in their sentences like Alan Rickman?

First movies are so special, since they introduce audiences to a world that will hopefully capture their attention for however many more movies will be made. In J.K. Rowling's fantasy world, there's so much to fall in love with; and in the film adaptation you can really believe it exists. Seeing the Hogwarts structure for the first time creates a special feeling in your heart that can only be recaptured by watching the movie again or going to see the next in the series. The Great Hall, Quidditch, the Sorting Hat, talking portraits, flying lessons, selecting the perfect wand-all these Harry Potter moments are perfectly recreated in the first of a series that saw an entire generation grow up buying toy wands and trying Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.

Each installment has its special moments, and this first one has quite a few, even outside of the exposition. If a three-headed dog doesn't immediately conjure the name ""Fluffy,"" chess pieces have never come to life in your imagination, you don't laugh at the idea of counting your birthday presents, and you don't know what Richard Harris wants most in the world, you're missing out on one of the great joys in life. If somehow 2001 passed you by without a trip to the movie theaters Thanksgiving weekend, go find yourself a copy of this iconic, lovely movie.",10.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"It was amazing to watch how a huge movie franchise started with this one. It showed a basis for the entire Harry Potter timeline. The visual effects were very great for this film. It was on-point and did not feel amateurish. Unfortunately for me, everything else was a bit stale and unexciting. I was in doubt of whether it really maximized its runtime. There were, in some parts, too many scenes which the characters were doing a lot of dialogues. The production design and costumes were excellent aspects of the film, too. But for me a lot of dark cinematography was utilized, instead of a more lively kind of production.",6.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"Lacking any real magic, Harry Potter was a lifeless film, composed of a plotless story and forgettable performances. While watching the Neverending Story last night, a true children's classic, it really hit me how wonderful a movie Harry Potter could have been if only they'd been willing to deviate from the book for a second.

I give this long, convoluted mess 6 out of 10.",6.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"Many viewers of this film applaud its faithfulness to the book, however they miss that while the film includes much of the book in it (more than is necessary in fact), it lacks the central story. That is: the story of a young boy who has suddenly had his wildest dream come true, and who now must deal with his newfound celebrity, his amazing magical heritage, and most of all, day to day life at Hogwarts with his friends (and enemies). The movie is more preoccupied with populating Hogwarts with ghosts and moving staircases than it is with characters of any depth. Everyone from the book, Harry included, suffers from a serious lack of on-screen development, and as a consequence the story lurches ponderously from event to event without the throughline that stong character development would bring. I, for one, am not easily impressed by effects, no matter how impressive, especially when they are a duplicitous substitute for the real strength of a story such as this: character.",1.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"This film was to put it simply rubbish. The child actors couldn't act, as can be seen by Harry's supposed surprise on learning he's a wizard. ""I'm a wizard!"" is said with such indifference you'd think he's not surprised at all. I've never read the books and this film did nothing to make me want to read them. The only spell this cast over me was one to get me out of the room as quickly as possible every time I have seen this on after my first viewing of it in the cinema. If you want to see a decent book made film watch Lord of the Rings or possibly the sequel to this which I thought was actually good. 1/10",1.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"Hurrendous! Daniel Radcliffe absolutely destroys this film. He has no experience and he loves and enjoys himself far too much for anyone else to enjoy the film. The facial expressions, the looks and the lack of acting capability was so tragic it wasn't funny! Emma Watson and Rupert Grint gave decent performances. And Maggie SMith ruled supreme. A few good moments but the lead star dragged the film down so much it was unbearably bad! Sorry a 3. Plot was pathetic and Daniel wrecked it!

Some magic and feeling was in the film. And the film was attempted at a low success rate. Better lead role and the points would come rolling in. However I cannot possibly do that. Children and families seemed to like it but I just think parts of the film could have been achieved better.",3.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"The buzz surrounding this movie was massive. The huge amount of A-List cameos was ever-growing. It was all so promising! And yet...it sucked.

The child actors are the worst part of the movie (""You mean to say..that person in the woods...that was Voldemort"" - Say this line in a monotonous way, exactly the same as you deliver every other line, there you have Daniel Radcliffe). Emma Watson is the only half decent child actor here, yet compared to other child stars (Dakota Fanning, anyone?)she is rubbish. You actually see the 'trio' mouthing each other's lines along with each other. Heheh, quite funny really! The dialogue is laughable and all the darkness yet sly humour from the book is sucked out and replaced by cheap toilet humour.

Admittedly, the films are getting better as each one goes by, but I just pray Goblet Of Fire is good.",3.00
Harry Potter and the Sorceror's stone,"I remember myself trying to watch this movie back in 2001-2002 and never completing it. I decided to give it one more chance with an open minded glance...However, I got disappointed one more time... Even if you are expecting to watch a fictional adventure with magic, away from reality, not even basic logic is followed. Things are predictable, scenario is lame and rationalism is absent. I give 3 out of 10 because of scenery (still skeptical if it really deserves it). Cannot figure out how this movie became such a success",3.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,"After watching the movie I didn't stop myself appraising the cast of movie for doing justice to their roles and for bringing such an immense issue of Mountaineous regions in a utterly amusing way. I commend this movie to be watched by everyone. A nice effort to exhibit Uttarakhandi Culture, So definitely a must watch for all Uttarkhandis.",8.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,"Batti gul meter chalu Brilliantly made movie The story works on a light level as well addresses a serious issue without becoming excessively boring, so there is something for every one. Brilliant direction and storytelling. The humour is natural. And overall it is believable. Worth 5 stars #firstdayfirstshow #fivestars #battigulmeterchalu",10.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,"This Might Be Long But It Didn't Failed In Entertaining Us.. Love For Shahid Has Grown More, He Showed What He Is With Another Rocking Performance.. Shraddha Is Cute & Given Justice To Her Role.. Divyendu & Yami Are Also Superb In Their Respective Roles.. Beautiful Cinematography & Background Music, Supporting Cast Also Managed To Defy Their Roles With Beautiful Acting.. Direction Was At Top Notch But The Highlight Of This Movie Was Shahid",10.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,"Batti Gul meter chalu is a movie which deals with the topic of issues the poor people face with electricity.

This is one of the best movies of Shahid Kapoor after Padmaavat. The performances of the actors like Shraddha Kapoor and Divyendu Sharma leaves an impact with the audience.

Yami Gautam's performance is not up to the mark. All & all, the topic of the film is relevant, but the weak point of the film is its runtime, which is long.

Directed by Shree Narayan Singh, Batti Gul Meter Chalu tells the story of how people are suffering from corruption in the electricity system.

You will like the film, but at some points it gets boring also. So this film is a one time watch because of Shahid Kapoor.",6.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,"An opportunity missed

The number of incidents where a Bollywood movie derails after the first half has been countless now and the latest movie to join this list is Batti Gul Meter Chalu. Again a promising and entertaining first half hasn't been carried into the second. There was a quite irritating thing about the movie ""the local language of Uttrakhand,Garhwal spoken by the lead actors"". The makers, in pursuit to make the movie as real as possible took this idea too far. The problem was that most of the population would have heard this language for the first time and above that phrases in the language were quite repetitive. But this is not the biggest problem of the movie because the audience will get used to this as the movie progresses. In fact, the director and writers have made two other fatal mistakes viz. 1. A very serious issue like electricity problem has been dealt through comical instances in courtroom 2. They never looked sure about what they want to show in courtroom which was supposed to be the most important part of the movie.

The biggest drawback here is the courtroom drama which is supposedly used to be the biggest strength for this kind of movies. We have movies like Jolly LLB 1 and Pink which have set standard in courtroom room drama and it is usual for audiences to compare them with these masterpieces. Nevertheless, the movie has its strengths which lie in its taut screenplay, honest and believable performances especially by Shahid Kapoor. The 161 minutes of duration never felt too stretched due to some clever written dialogues and good editing.

Direction Director Shree Narayan Singh continued to talk about social issues which he has done so successfully in his last outing in ""Toilet: Ek Prem Katha"". But this time he misses the mark with the treatment of the subject. In toilet he dealt the subject through serious dialogues and drama, while here he chooses to solve the electricity bill problem through comedy. The comic elements in courtroom drama were no surprise as the original Story writer Vipul K. Rawal has previously written Rustom where he used the same humor elements. The direction in the last 30 minutes where the courtroom proceedings unfolds is simply chaotic and confusing. An issue like power cut and wrong electricity bill which is so pervasive and so relatable has to be dealt seriously and he did that only in the first half. The dialogues in those courtroom scenes were sexiest and felt out of place just to evoke cheap laughter. It seemed that the director and writer forgot the real case at hand and tried to target too many things at the same time. Screenplay and story The screenplay and editing is top notch and the movie is brisk which was expected as Shree Narayan Singh as an editor has previously given gems in the form of Special 26, Baby and A Wednesday. The storyline is quite courageous from Vipul K. Rawal in the way he has written the love triangle between Shahid , Divyendu and Shraddha. One will find a hint of freshness in this love triangle. Cinematography Cinematography by Anshuman Mahaley is quite authentic as he captured and used the scenic Himalayas in the backdrop very beautifully. The setting of Uttrakhand looked original and kudos to the makers for shooting in the real locations of Uttrakhand. Performances and Characterization The lead cast has done a fine job. Shahid Kapoor as witty advocate gets into the skin of the character and has given a brilliant performance. His expressive eyes in emotional scenes were a treat to watch. The supporting cast especially Atul Srivastava who played Divyendu's father's role deserves a special mention here. He touches heart whenever he is on screen. The biggest led down here is Yami Gautam who got nothing much to do except getting objectified through sexiest remarks. After watching her in this movie one will feel sorry for her as one would except her role as defense lawyer to be as important as Boman Irani's in Jolly LLB.",6.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,"The movie, which attempts to take up a real social and developmental issue, about right in spirit, lacks seriously in story development, direction, screenplay dialogues and editing.

It is really high on rhetoric, seemingly political agenda and commentary, which seems out of place and intentional due to its overuse.

The only bright spots are acting by leads and others, a couple of songs, especially a fresh rendition of Ustad Nusrat's Dekhte Dekhte.",2.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,"Tatti Gul....oops...I mean Batti Gul...(though that's a more befitting title of Shahid Kapoor's latest release), is a contrived, forced attempt to showcase the problem of power cuts and obnoxious bills that Indians in some part of the country face. Sorry that will be misleading. Because the film doesn't even talk about the issue, it just superficially touches upon it in the first half because the makers are too busy showcasing a weird love triangle, the absurdity of which makes Kim Kardashian and Rakhi Sawant look like the epitome of sanity.

Shahid forcefully delivers a high-voltage performance that come across as gimmicky with an anti-establishment monologue thrown in, talking about the trials and tribulations of the common man, that falls flat. The courtroom drama also snowballs into a revolution of sorts at a national level that is too superficial for a film like Batti Gul Meter Chalu. Director Shree Narayan Singh, who gave us Toilet-Ek Prem Katha, fails to deliver here. You won't miss a thing if you give this movie a pass.",2.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,One of the worst movies of 2018! I am giving one extra star just because of Divyendu's performance. There was no need to make it overly melodramatic!,4.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,"Didn't know Shahid Kapoor is capable of this much overacting. Nothing to say about other actors at all. The plot was good but with what the story was, the movie should've been shorter and better executed. The BGM was horrible and felt like terribly cut from other show and pasted here. Gave 5* mostly for the happy ending. Not recommended.",4.00
Batti Gul Meter Chalu,"When I first watched the trailer I decided to not spend my penny on this one. I however watched it when I got a chance to watch it for free. After watching the movie I would say that it is better than what appears from trailer.

Tone, Script & Story: The story revolves around complaint(s) on an electricity board and three friends. The court room drama is peculiar (mostly humorous) in its content.

Direction, Screenplay, Cinematography: The movie comes to us from director who directed Toilet- Ek Prem Katha. It is not that good but is good enough. The locations filmed and the way story is told is a treat in itself.

Music: Music is good. My favorite track is 'Har Har Gange'. Acting: Justified.

Final Verdict: The movie highlights, trending complaint(s) on electric supply which are nicely handled! If you have time and money and looking for some entertainment do watch it. You won't be disappointed.",4.00
